# ntfw
ntfw is a light-weight, fixed-function L3 'firewall' for server deployments of Windows providing:

- Host-based authorization to private services (e.g, RDP) with support for remote configuration.
- Traffic policing to protect public services from abuse and aid mitigation of Denial-of-Service attacks.
